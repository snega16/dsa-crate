Variation of split array largest sum - here we should maximize the minimum

def choclateShare(arr, m):
    start = min(arr)
    end = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        end += arr[i]
    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        # you should have minimum sweetness chunk
        pieces = 0
        sum = 0
        for i in arr:
            if i + sum >= mid:
                sum = 0 # adding value in new array
                pieces += 1
            else:
                sum += i
        if pieces > m:
            start = mid + 1
        else:
            end = mid - 1
    return end

arr = [1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2]
print(choclateShare(arr, 2))
